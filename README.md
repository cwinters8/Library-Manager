# Library-Manager
A front-end and database to manage library books.

Eighth project in the [Team Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/clarkwinters) Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

## Running the app
To run the app locally, you'll need a local PostgreSQL database running with the name 'library'. You can create the database, then start the application and start adding books via the web interface.

To run the app, either clone or download the repository, then install the dependencies and start the app.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

Alternatively, view the live site [here](https://library-manager-cw.herokuapp.com).

## Technologies Used

## Future Improvements
Add authentication, and allow each user to create their own library of books.
